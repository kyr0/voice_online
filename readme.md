How to: Tabs
============

To build with linting and all tests:
    
    ** Note that at this time only OSX builds are supported
    1. Install Node (v0.12.7)
    2. Install Git
    3. Install Java Development Kit
    4. type './jake.sh' and relax 
    
To see which build related tasks are available:
 
    './jake.sh -T'

To see the example challenge page for Little Bits:

    The easiest way is to open ./src/browser/index.html 

    Alternatively:
    1. In the console activate the local server './jake.sh startBServer'
    2. In your browser of choice go to - http://localhost:9000/

    > Implementation code is in ./src/browser
    > Test code is in ./test
