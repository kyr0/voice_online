/**
 * Implementation of The McLeod Pitch Method (MPM). It is described in the
 * article A Smarter Way to Find Pitch. According to the article:
 *
 * "A fast, accurate and robust method for finding the continuous pitch in
 * monophonic musical sounds. [It uses] a special normalized version of the
 * Squared Difference Function (SDF) coupled with a peak picking algorithm.
 *
 * MPM runs in real time with a standard 44.1 kHz sampling rate. It operates
 * without using low-pass filtering so it can work on sound with high harmonic
 * frequencies such as a violin and it can display pitch changes of one cent
 * reliably. MPM works well without any post processing to correct the pitch.

 * For the moment this implementation uses the inefficient way of calculating
 * the pitch. It uses O(Ww) with W the window size in samples and w
 * the desired number of ACF coefficients. The implementation can be optimized
 * to O((W+w)log(W+w)) by using an FFT to calculate the Auto-Correlation Function
 * But I am still afraid of the dark magic of the FFT and clinging to the familiar,
 * friendly, laggard time domain."
