 *
 * A class with information about the result of a pitch detection on a block of
 * audio.
 *
 * It contains:
 *
 * - The pitch in Hertz.
 *
 * - A probability (noisiness, (a)periodicity, salience, voicedness or clarity
 * measure) for the detected pitch. This is somewhat similar to the term voiced
 * which is used in speech recognition. This probability is calculated
 * together with the pitch. The exact meaning of the value depends on MPM method used
 * and requires further research.
 *
 * - A boolean that indicates if the algorithm thinks the signal is pitched
 *
 * The separate pitched or unpitched boolean can coexist with a defined pitch.
 * E.g. if the algorithm detects 220Hz in a noisy signal it may respond with
 * 220Hz "unpitched".
 *
 * For performance reasons it's best if the object is reused. Please create a copy of the object
 * if you want to use it on an other thread.
